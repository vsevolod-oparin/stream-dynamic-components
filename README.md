# Data stream algorithm for connected components

Problem. We have a graph on n vertices and a stream of updates. Each update is either to add or to remove an edge from the graph. Initially, the graph is empty. The goal is to restore all connected components after all updates w.p. 0.99.

This is an implementation of the algorithm which solves the problem. I use this code as an example to this post (in Russian):
